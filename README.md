# Mnist_ML
Showcase of ML on Mnist data set (number recognition by pixel value)

This will download mnist data set onto your machine.
Main sections are commented.
Good project to look at for begginers.
This was learned from the best book for begginers that I can advise "Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit Learn and TensorFlow" by Aurelien Geron
